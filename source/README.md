# DVS reconstruction

This is a MATLAB implementation of the paper 'Simultaneous Mosaicing and Tracking with an Event Camera' by Kim et al (2014).
For testing purposes we additionally implemented a camera simulation that can generate a camera-like signal from a given image.
The parameters used might not be optimal since the long runtime makes optimization difficult.
