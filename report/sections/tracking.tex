// TODO - insert section about tracking

Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item event (change in brightness) is caused by camera rotation or noise, but not by movement in the scene ($\rightarrow$ static scene)
\item only rotation, no translation and therefore no parallax displacement
\item initial FOV is already known and in the map
\end{itemize}
