A dynamic vision sensor is a feasible option for rotational motion tracking. With
some optimizations the system is conceivably real-time capable - especially
when combined with other sensors such as an IMU. This might even lead to full
3D-SLAM with a dynamic vision sensor.

From our point of view, the next important points are parameter tuning, runtime
optimization and the usage of a more sophisticated motion model (e.g. constant
velocity or acceleration).
