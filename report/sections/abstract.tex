Inspired by biological eyes, a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) is a digital camera
which does not have a global or rolling shutter but where every pixel is
completely independent of each other and instantaneously reports changes in
sensed intensity.

Such a sensor provides much lower data bandwith, very high dynamic range and
extremely low latencies and is therefore very appealing for a wide range of
applications. However, due to the different [and differential] nature of the
data, standard computer vision algorithms cannot be used directly.

In this report, we further investigate the approach proposed by Kim et al in
\cite{kim2014simultaneous}: DVS events are used to track the rotational pose of
a camera while simultaneously reconstructing a panoramic map of the
environment.
