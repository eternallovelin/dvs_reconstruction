Computer vision using dynamic vision sensors is a very young field since the
sensors have only been around for a few years \cite{lpd08dvs, brandli14davis}.
While the problem of visual odometry and visual SLAM has been known for many
years and many approaches have been proposed, the work by Kim \etal
\cite{kim2014simultaneous}, which is the basis of our work, is, to our best
knowledge, the first approach to the problem using only a DVS with no
additional information.  It has, however, already been shown that the precision
of a visual odometry system using a standard camera can be increased by adding
a DVS, especially during fast turns when the standard camera suffers from
motion blur \cite{censi13dvsd_sub}.  Additionally, DVS's have been shown to
outperform standard cameras at pose tracking during high-speed maneuvers when
used in sufficiently equipped environments \cite{mueggler2014event}.  Other
research with DVS's focuses in great parts on tracking moving objects with a
static camera \cite{vmv.20141280, conradt2009embedded, censi13led}.
