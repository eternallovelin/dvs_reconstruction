Computer Vision using Dynamic Vision Sensors is a very young field since the sensors have only been around for a few years \cite{lpd08dvs, brandli14davis}.
While the problem of visual odometry and visual SLAM has been known for many years and many approaches have been proposed, the work by Kim \etal \cite{kim2014simultaneous}, which is the basis of our work, is, to our best knowledge, the first approach to the problem using a DVS.
Other research with DVS's focuses in great parts on object tracking \cite{vmv.20141280, conradt2009embedded} or pose tracking \cite{mueggler2014event}, respectively.
