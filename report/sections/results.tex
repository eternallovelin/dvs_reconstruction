TODO: write some text here. Conclusion and stuff.

- influence of the various parameters
- code too slow for realtime, but not optimized at all
- using Matlab for more than just a few hacked scripts: bad idea

moving the camera in a large triangle waveform pattern to the right.
The area around the leftmost ball in the scene was used to initialize
the map as described in section \ref{sec:core_algorithm}.}
