The goal of this project is to implement full rotational tracking and scene
reconstruction using only a DVS. We implmented the approach described in Kim et
al. in \cite{kim2014simultaneous} using Matlab.

Explain basic algo, more details in Section 5: 'core algorithm'.


-some simplifications\\
    -use particle filter directly with euler angles (ignore corner cases)\\
    -start with first fov in map\\





// TODO - insert section to explain what we did here

general goal, how to achieve this

-implemented paper (kim) in matlab\\
